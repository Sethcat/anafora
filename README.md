This branch was designed to change the way anafora representsthe document. The source branch shows the whole document labeled and you adjudicate on it, while this branch show the item one by one. That's the most difference. 

What's more, this branch has added the following function: start annotating from the item last exits.

This branch was based on anafora https://github.com/weitechen/anafora

Waiting for the follow-up updates...
This branch still remains some bugs.
